#A seed project for developing ES6 program

Run the following commands to set up your local ES6 env:

    npm install
    gulp build --dev
    gulp server

Now the server is listening at port 8000, and your modifications will be detected automatically.

Try to change some code, and enjoy your ES6 learning.
